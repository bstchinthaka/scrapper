            "review": "The lunch I ordered for my wife's birthday was Fantastic! The quality of food, packaging and delivery was all up to world renowned Hilton standards. The food was delicious and the portion size was very generous. The person who delivered the food to my residence was well groomed, smart and helpful, also Keminda who reconfirmed my order from the Hilton was very courteous and professional. The cake which I also ordered was really delicious. Thank you Hilton Colombo for job well done!"

            "review": "Emperor's WOK at Hilton Colombo is back. I would say it is even better than last time...even with the 'soft launch menu' as they call it. It is a complete menu, with a great variety of authentic chinese food including a Cantonese selection. When you are used to eat at The Wok, you can't enjoy food from any other Chinese restaurant in Sri Lanka, so we were waiting eagerly for The Wok to be back again. Yesterday we had the experience we always loved. Nothing new to talk about the food, you expect the best and you get the best. They were yummy. True Hilton hospitality, unique customer-focused culture and ambience you always find at The Wok. Basically, We love everything about it. Highly recommending you to try when you are in Colombo."

            "review": "I have being ordering cakes for a few times from Cafe Kai for my family events, and should state that their customer service is brilliant and super friendly! I would recommend anyone to have a look into their menus. Recently I've received a delicious cake and foods on June 2nd which has been ordered by my fiance. They were delivered on time and arrived in the perfect condition. (Super fresh) We've stayed in your hotel on last February and it was amazing to the maximum! Looking forward to visit soon. And should say the customer service proving by Mr. Shaun Windsor is absolutely amazing and brilliant at every point which leads for us to have many more experiences with Hilton Colombo. Highly recommend to anyone!"

            "review": "We have stayed at this hotel many times over the past 17 years. I was disappointed that the executive lounge was closed and several restaurants were not open but I have to say the hotel staff and management went out of their way to help us make changes to our flights and schedule when necessary. Certainly the rooms could use some upgrades but you won’t find a better staff to support you in any needs when in Colombo. I highly recommend the staff and management of the Colombo Hilton."
