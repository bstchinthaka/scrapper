We were given the pleasure of having Ms. Dinusha handle all aspects of our stay and we truly could not be more satisfied with her promptness, professional demeanor and eagerness to please. She took care of our check in, which was hence extremely smooth and hassle free, and kept checking in on our experience throughout our stay which made us feel truly valued as guests at the hotel. The ports of call restaurant was wonderful and an easy recommendation for anyone looking to enjoy a buffet which exceeds expectations. Although ports of call was booked up for the night, we never experienced a lack of service and experienced prompt"
